bunyan-prettystream is a stream based implementation of the [Bunyan][bunyan] CLI tool's pretty printing capabilities. It allows
apps using bunyan to log directly to the console or file in human readable format instead of as JSON without having to
run or pipe into the bunyan tool. This is useful for working with IDEs which do not have the ability to pipe console
output to another application (such as WebStorm).

This library is only really meant for development and should not be used on production environments.

# Usage

  ```javascript
  var bunyan = require('bunyan');
  var PrettyStream = require('bunyan-prettystream');

  var prettyStdOut = new PrettyStream();
  prettyStdOut.pipe(process.stdout);

  var log = bunyan.createLogger({
          name: 'foo',
          streams: [{
              level: 'debug',
              type: 'raw',
              stream: prettyStdOut
          }]
  });
  ```

# Options

  ```javascript
  var prettyStdOut = new PrettyStream({ 
      mode: 'long', //short, long, dev
      useColor: true,
      UTC: true,
      timeFormat: moment.defaultFormat // "2014-11-10T23:35:25+00:00" (ISO 8601)
  });
  ```
  
`UTC` defaults to `true`, while setting `false` will use the machine's local time zone.

`timeFormat` uses [moment.js conventions](http://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/) and defaults to ISO 8601 format.

Custom time formatting example:

  ```javascript
  var prettyStdOut = new PrettyStream({ 
      UTC: false,
      timeFormat: 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ssZZ' // "2014-11-10 14:47:32-0800"
  });
  ```

# Tests

Running unit tests requires `mocha` installed.

  ```bash
  make test
  ```

## Coverage
